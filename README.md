   ```
   DISCORD_TOKEN=<insert the token created above here>
   DISCORD_GUILD=<test server name>
   DATABASE_URL="sqlite+aiosqlite:///bot.db"  # Example name for local sqlite database
   MEMBER_ROLE_NAME="members"                 # Example role for members√ü

   ```
1. Run `uv run alembic upgrade head` to create a local development
